# Oniocart

Small side-project made with [nuxt3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/).

This app is supposed to find shop with the best total price of all products you need (scrapping data from [CENEO]<https://www.ceneo.pl/>, maybe I'll finish support for [Allegro]<https://allegro.pl/> somday). It's not perfect currently (at least not so good as I was hoping it will be when I came up with this idea) - you need to search products from the same category (as example - if you need tea and coffe, then it can be usefull to see where you can buy those two products for the cheapest total price).
